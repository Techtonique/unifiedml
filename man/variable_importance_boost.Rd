\title{Compute Variable Importance for Boosted Model}
\usage{
variable_importance_boost(boost_obj, normalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{boost_obj}{A boosted model object from boost_regression()}

\item{normalize}{Whether to normalize importances to sum to 100}
}
\value{
Vector of variable importances (length p)
}
\description{
Calculate relative importance of each feature based on correlation
with base learner predictions, weighted by SSE improvement.
}
\details{
This is a generic, correlation-based importance metric suitable for
any base learner. For tree-based models, consider using model-specific
importance measures if available. The importance for feature j is
computed as sum over iterations of:
SSE_improvement * |correlation(X_j, f_b)|
}
