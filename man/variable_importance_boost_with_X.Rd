\title{Compute Variable Importance for Boosted Model (with X)}
\usage{
variable_importance_boost_with_X(boost_obj, X, normalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{boost_obj}{A boosted model object from boost_regression()}

\item{X}{Training feature matrix (n x p)}

\item{normalize}{Whether to normalize importances to sum to 100}
}
\value{
Vector of variable importances (length p)
}
\description{
Calculate relative importance of each feature based on correlation
with base learner predictions, weighted by SSE improvement.
}
\details{
This computes a generic importance metric by:
\enumerate{
\item Computing SSE improvement from each iteration
\item Computing correlation between each feature and base learner predictions
\item Allocating improvement proportional to squared correlation
}

Note: This is a heuristic proxy. For tree-based models, model-specific
importance measures (e.g., split improvement) may be more accurate.
